# Mission control go

A [gantry](https://github.com/scttymn/gantry) app, run and deployed with [Houston](https://github.com/scttymn/houston).

```sh
gantry dev                 # http://mission-control-go.localhost, rebuilt as you change it
gantry test                # its tests, in a throwaway copy
gantry db migrate          # run pending migrations (and rewrite db/schema.sql)
gantry console             # sqlite3 on the dev database
```

## Where things go
- `app/routes.go`: every route, and the controllers behind them
- `app/<name>/`: a controller and its views (`.templ`), one folder per resource
- `app/models/`: each table's queries (`<table>.sql`, turned into Go by sqlc) and rules (`<table>.go`)
- `app/tasks.go`: the app's own commands, run with `gantry task NAME`
- `db/migrations/`: schema changes, written by `gantry g migration`; `db/schema.sql` is what they leave
- `db/seeds/`: what a fresh database starts with
- `assets/`: stylesheets, scripts, fonts and images; `assets/public/` is served at the root (robots.txt, the error pages)
- `config/config.go`: settings, from the environment
- `test/`: what the tests share

## Generators
```sh
gantry g resource admin/posts title:string:required body:text
gantry g migration add_email_to_users email:string
gantry g error-pages
```
